# chatApp

To Run this web app I have used a pacakage concurrently so that I can run fornt end and backend at same time

to run use command

npm run dev

in terminal

before running you must add an .env file

PORT=XXXX CLUSTER=mongodb+srv://XXXXX JWT_SECRET=XXXX

save this in root

then run the application

the client folder contains the forntend and src folder contain the backend code...

if there is any error restart the page
